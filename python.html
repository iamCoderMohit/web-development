    <h1>Characteristics of Python</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Easy to Learn and Use:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple Syntax:</strong> Python's syntax is clear and concise, which makes it easy for beginners to learn and write code.</li>
                <li><strong>Readable Code:</strong> Code readability is a core feature of Python, often described as "executable pseudocode." This makes it easier to understand and maintain.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Interpreted Language:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Compilation Required:</strong> Python code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter, which simplifies the development process by avoiding the need for a separate compilation step.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dynamically Typed:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flexible Typing:</strong> Variables do not require explicit type definitions. The type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value assigned.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Object-Oriented:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Classes and Objects:</strong> Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>High-Level Language:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Abstracted Complexity:</strong> Python handles many low-level details (such as memory management) automatically, allowing developers to focus on writing higher-level code.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
